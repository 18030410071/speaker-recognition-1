\subsection{CRBM}

\begin{frame}{CRBM}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Restricted Boltzmann Machine} is a generative stochastic two-layer neural network.

    \item \textbf{Continuous RBM} extends RBM to real-valued inputs.
      \pause
    \item RBM has a ability to reconstruct a layer similar to input layer.
      The difference between the two layers can be a used to measure the fitness of an input to the model.

    \item Therefore, RBM can be a substituion to GMM.
  \end{itemize}
