\section{Progress}
\subsection{JFA}
\textbf{Factor Analysis} is a typical method which behave
very well in classification problems, due to its ability to
account for different types of variability in training data.
Within all the factor analysis methods,
Joint Factor Analysis (JFA)\cite{jfa2,jfa-se} was proved to outperform other method
in the task of Speaker Recognition.
However, the original algorithm \cite{jfa-se} for training JFA model is of
too much complication and hard to implement.
Therefore, we use the simpler algorithm presented in \cite{jfa-study}
to train the JFA model.

\subsection{GMM}
