\section{Future Work}
A text-independent speaker-recognition system is presented at this period.
In the future, we are focusing on variables in input limitation. The
recognizability of speaker can be affected not only by the linguistic message
but also the age, health, emotional state and effort level of the speaker.
Background noise and performance of recording device also interfere the
classification process.
A goal we want to achieve in this project can be described as follows: For a clear conversation signal between two persons, with no sentences overlapped and significant interval between sentences, we may separate the conversation signal into two parts. Each part is exactly all the sentences spoken by a certain speaker.
