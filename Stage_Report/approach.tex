\section{Approach}
	In this section we will present our aproach to tackle the speaker recognition problem.
\subsection{Erollment}
	An continuous speech of a user is collected during enrollment of that user. Depending on
	the number of users we plan to enroll and the accuracy of recognition system, duration
	of the utterance we need to collect may vary from 15 seconds to 30 seconds.

	Further processing of the utterance follows following steps:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Voice Activity Detection (VAD). \\
			Due to the channel difference and background noise may occur, which may
			degrade the performance of the system, non-speech part of the speech are removed
			from the utterance. As this may lead to information loss % TODO
		\item Extract MFCC feature representation. \\
			The utterance is
	\end{itemize}
